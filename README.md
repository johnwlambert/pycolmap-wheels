## pycolmap Python Wheels

This repository provides functionality to build Python wheels for [`pycolmap`](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu/pycolmap), which is a Pybind interface to COLMAP's source.

**NEWS**
- January 3, 2021: This repository has been merged upstream into [pycolmap](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu/pycolmap) in a [recent PR](https://github.com/mihaidusmanu/pycolmap/commit/5cfd165b26a955634ff30e7ba6f15bd4aeefea8e). Accordingly, this repo is now deprecated.

`pycolmap` requires building COLMAP from source, and also a system-wide installation of COLMAP, along with locally building and installing `pycolmap`.
This requires a lot of dependencies. This library makes installation as simple as
```bash
pip install pycolmap
```
Currently, only Linux is supported, but macOS support is forthcoming.

`pycolmap` exposes Fundamental matrix, Essential matrix, and absolute pose estimators via a Pybind wrapper. These high-performance estimators use LORANSAC.

## License
This code is governed by its own license, and if you use it, you are also using code from `pycolmap` and `COLMAP`, thus those respective licenses also apply. See [here](https://github.com/colmap/colmap/blob/dev/README.md) for more details.
